Problem Statement
Students often struggle to access centralized campus-related resources such as event updates, academic materials, clubs, opportunities, and peer networking. 
There is no unified platform that acts as a bridge between students, clubs, faculty, and administration.

Abstract
In a typical university environment, students are overwhelmed by scattered sources of informationâ€”different platforms for announcements, events, academic help, and club activities.
This leads to missed opportunities, low student engagement, and ineffective communication.Campus Bridge aims to resolve this gap by acting as a unified platform tailored for students.
It allows students to stay updated with college events, join club communities, access learning materials, view placement prep resources, and connect with peers based on shared interests.
Clubs and faculty can post updates, share materials, and interact with students seamlessly.
This project builds a virtual bridge that brings all essential campus functionalities together into one accessible and intuitive digital space.
